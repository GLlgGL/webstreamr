[Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) add-on which provides HTTP URLs from streaming websites.

## Public instance

A public instance is available at https://webstreamr.hayd.uk. Hosting infrastructure for this instance is donated by [ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com), and independently maintained by [Hayduk](https://hayd.uk).

## MediaFlow Proxy

[MediaFlow Proxy](https://github.com/mhdzumair/mediaflow-proxy/) can be added when configuration the add-on to gain access to a couple of more file hosters.
It depends highly on the language / source used if that unlocks more streams or not.

MediaFlow proxy is needed because some hosters ip-lock streams and the add-on does not run on the same device that will stream the video.

The following hosters can be used only with MediaFlow Proxy:

- Fastream
- FileLions
- FileMoon
- LuluStream
- Mixdrop
- Streamtape
- VOE

MediaFlow proxy can either be self-hosted or acquired via bundle from [ElfHosted](https://docs.elfhosted.com/app/mediaflow-proxy/).
